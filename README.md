# SmartWive
Smatwive is a full-stack web application designed to provide users with a seamless and intelligent product browsing experience. It features a comprehensive product search and filtering system, allowing users to easily find and explore a wide range of products across various categories. The platform is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), providing a robust and scalable solution for managing product data, user authentication, and secure transactions.

# Key Features:
* Search and Sort System
    * Efficient Search: Users can quickly locate products by entering keywords or phrases related to the product name. The search 
      functionality is designed to deliver relevant results, even for partial matches.
    * Sorting Options: Users have the flexibility to sort products based on different criteria such as price (low to high, high to low), 
      ratings, or the date the product was added. This makes it easier for users to find exactly what theyâ€™re looking for, whether it's 
      the most affordable option or the highest-rated product.
* Filter System
    * Category-Based Filtering: Users can narrow down their product search by selecting specific categories. This feature ensures that 
      users only see products that fall within their area of interest, improving the overall browsing experience.
    * Price Range Filtering: Users can set a price range to filter out products that are either too expensive or too cheap, allowing them 
      to focus on items within their budget.
    * Rating Filter: Users can filter products based on customer ratings, enabling them to view only the highest-rated products or those 
      that meet a minimum rating threshold.
* Authentication
    * User Registration and Login: Smatwive offers secure user authentication, allowing users to create accounts and log in using email 
      and password credentials. The system uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure session management, ensuring that user data is protected.
    * Password Security: User passwords are hashed using bcrypt.js, providing a high level of security against potential breaches.
    * Protected Routes: Certain features of the platform, such as managing personal details or making purchases, are only accessible to 
      authenticated users. This ensures that sensitive operations are secure and only performed by authorized users.
